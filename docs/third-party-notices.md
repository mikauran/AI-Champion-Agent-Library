### What the MIT license covers (per the repository's NOTICE.md)

- Covered by MIT: the `SKILL.md` instruction files and the documentation.
- Not covered, all rights reserved by the author (Artem Boiko): the "Data-Driven Construction" book (`Books/`) and the GuideBook PDF.
- Not MIT: the DDC CWICR cost database is CC BY-NC 4.0 for the DDC compilation, plus a separate DDC commercial license for commercial use.
- Trademarks: product names such as Revit, Autodesk, Procore belong to their owners and are used for identification only.
- Curated skills in the DDC repository (category `4_DDC_Curated`) come from other public collections and keep those sources' licenses; do not adapt those from the DDC repository without checking the source license.

### Policy for this repository

- a. `SKILL.md` instructions and documentation may be adapted, with the copyright notice retained (this file).
- b. Never copy the book, the PDF or CWICR data into the repo, into agent prompts or into samples.
- c. A DDC-based entry sets `metadata.attribution` to the exact skill path with "adapted from" or "inspired by" and the MIT notice, or to "no DDC basis", and gets a row in the table below.
- d. Trademarks (Revit, Autodesk, Procore and so on) are used for identification only.

### DDC agents and their skill paths

Paths are relative to the DDC repository root. "Built on the skill" means the skill's method, data model and rules are the specification, adapted to Finnish MEP; no skill code is packaged or run, and the skills' own defects are not copied. Working mapping (2026-10-15), to be confirmed.

| Entry slug | DDC skill path | Relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| etim-classification-repair | 1_DDC_Toolkit/BIM-Analysis/bim-classification-ai | inspired by 1_DDC_Toolkit/BIM-Analysis/bim-classification-ai (own design for ETIM-style mapping); weak match |
| qto-normalization | 2_DDC_Book/3.2-QTO-Auto-Estimates/bim-qto (primary; qto-report in the same folder as secondary) | adapted (method only; grouping and unit defects fixed in an own tested helper, no skill code copied) |
| clash-prioritization | 2_DDC_Book/4.3-BIM-Validation-Pipeline/clash-resolution-analyzer | adapted |
| rfi-generation-from-findings | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Document-Control/rfi-management | adapted |
| product-sourcing-mbom | 1_DDC_Toolkit/CWICR-Database/cwicr-material-procurement | inspired by 1_DDC_Toolkit/CWICR-Database/cwicr-material-procurement (method only; no CWICR data) |
| quote-comparison | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Procurement/bid-analysis-comparator | adapted (concepts; weighted-score defects fixed in an own tested helper, no skill code copied) |
| carbon-epd-enrichment | 2_DDC_Book/3.3-4D-BIM-CO2-Simulation/lifecycle-carbon-calculator | adapted (stage structure, data model and comparison logic; calculation defects fixed in an own tested helper, no factors or skill code copied) |
| cut-sheet-qa | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Document-Control/submittal-tracker; 2_DDC_Book/2.4-PDF-CAD-to-Data/specification-extractor | inspired by 1_DDC_Toolkit/Document-Control/submittal-tracker (+ 2_DDC_Book/2.4-PDF-CAD-to-Data/specification-extractor); weak match |
| spooling-and-cutting | none | no DDC basis (own design); the DDC prefab-optimization skill is not a pipe-spool or cut-list skill |
| d2-code-validation | none | no DDC basis (own design); D2 = Finnish National Building Code part D2 (indoor climate and ventilation), unconfirmed; alternatives open (Alok/Jussi to confirm) |
| om-completeness | 5_DDC_Innovative/as-built-documentation; 1_DDC_Toolkit/Project-Closeout/project-closeout-checklist | adapted |
| bms-digital-twin | 5_DDC_Innovative/digital-twin-sync | adapted |
| daily-report-cross-check | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Field-Operations/daily-report-generator; 3_DDC_Insights/Automation-Workflows/n8n-daily-report | loosely related to 1_DDC_Toolkit/Field-Operations/daily-report-generator (+ 3_DDC_Insights/Automation-Workflows/n8n-daily-report); weak match, topic only; own design |
| punch-list-closure-check | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Field-Operations/punch-list-manager; 1_DDC_Toolkit/Project-Closeout/punch-list-manager | inspired by 1_DDC_Toolkit/Field-Operations/punch-list-manager (+ 1_DDC_Toolkit/Project-Closeout/punch-list-manager); idea only, closure rules own design |
| change-order-consistency-check | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Cost-Management/change-order-processor | inspired by 1_DDC_Toolkit/Cost-Management/change-order-processor; idea only, log-versus-form check own design; change-order-manager and change-order-analysis read, not the basis |
| safety-observation-classification | 1_DDC_Toolkit/Field-Operations/safety-inspection; 3_DDC_Insights/Safety-Quality/safety-inspection-checklist | loosely related to 1_DDC_Toolkit/Field-Operations/safety-inspection (+ 3_DDC_Insights/Safety-Quality/safety-inspection-checklist); weak match, topic only; keyword lookup own design |

Notes:

- qto-normalization uses `bim-qto` as the primary skill (Phase 33). `qto-report` quotes the DDC book, so only its method ideas are used and no book text is copied; `ifc-qto-extraction` is not used.
- product-sourcing-mbom is inspired by a `cwicr-*` skill as a method only. No CWICR data (CC BY-NC 4.0 plus commercial licence) is used; the catalog sample is invented.
- Phase 34: labels for agents 1, 5, 8, 9 and 10 are worded identically in each entry, this file and the inventory (own designs; none claims to follow a skill).
- spooling-and-cutting and d2-code-validation have no DDC counterpart and keep the library repository as their `github_url`.
- The nine older entries (airo, demo-rfi-triage and seven seed entries) are not adapted from DDC skills.
