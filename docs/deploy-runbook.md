# Deploy runbook

Operator guide for building, starting, checking and rolling back the AIC Agent Library. Everything here is derived from `package.json`, `Containerfile`, `podman-compose.yml`, `.env.example` and the code (variable names are grep-verified against `src/` and `scripts/`). Nothing in this file has been run against a real host.

> **Build status.** `npx vite build` succeeds on this branch (B-002, a route-module export error, is fixed and guarded by `src/routes/routeExports.test.ts`). The Containerfile image build itself has still never been run here (pending human).

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 (the Containerfile uses `node:22-bookworm-slim`; the Pi and MCP-test runner images need Node >= 22.19).
- For the container route: rootless Podman with `podman-compose` and an active user socket (`systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket`). Compose always mounts the socket, including when `PI_RUNNER_ENABLED=false`.
- `ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL_CUDA=skip` on every `npm install` / `npm ci`. Without it the onnxruntime-node postinstall hangs on a CUDA download.

## 2. Build steps (bare metal)

```bash
ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL_CUDA=skip npm ci
mkdir -p db
npm run db:push           # drizzle-kit push: creates/updates db/catalog.db (agents, agent_embeddings, agent_kinds)
npm run ingest            # data/agents/*.yaml -> SQLite (+ embeddings, see below)
npm run tryout:configure  # sets try_it_out_mode: demo-rfi-triage = runnable, hvac-load-calculator = none
npx vite build            # server bundle in build/
node build                # production server (PORT, default 3000)
```

`npm run build` runs `db:push`, `ingest`, `tryout:configure` and `vite build` in that order. `tryout:configure` fails if the two slugs are missing, so run it after `ingest`.

### Ingest and embeddings

- `SEARCH_EMBEDDINGS=off` skips the embedding model entirely: ingest writes no vectors and search is keyword (BM25) only. The server also skips the warm-up. Use it for CI, offline builds and first smoke tests.
- Otherwise ingest downloads `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (about 90 MB, about 90 s) once into `HF_CACHE_DIR` (default `./db/models`). Without network it logs a warning and the app runs BM25-only; this is by design. Embeddings are skipped for agents whose text hash has not changed.
- The model cache lives under `db/models`, so copying or backing up `db/` carries it.
- `INGEST_DATA_DIR` (default `./data/agents`) and `INGEST_DB_PATH` (default `./db/catalog.db`) override the ingest source and target. `CATALOG_DB_PATH` selects the DB the server and `tryout:configure` use.
- With `AGENT_KINDS` on, re-run `npm run ingest` (the flag changes what ingest reads, including sub-directories under `data/agents/`).

## 3. Environment variables and flags

Defaults are read from the code. "unset" means the feature is off or the value comes from elsewhere as noted.

### Feature flags (truthy values for the first three: `1`, `true`, `on`, `yes`, case-insensitive; all default off)

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_KINDS` | off | Multi-agent and multi-format hosting (kind badge, Type filter, `?kind=`, system detail page). Needs a re-ingest. Toggling it in either direction also needs a re-ingest for the semantic search leg: embedding hashes include the kind text, so stale vectors are rebuilt only by ingest. |
| `AGENT_COMPARE` | off | Side-by-side comparison: `/compare?agents=a,b` (404 when off) and compare checkboxes on catalog cards. Read at request time; no re-ingest. |
| `UI_SPEC_VIEWER` | off | Read-only raw spec viewer on the agent detail page (`/agents/[slug]`). Text is escaped, never rendered as HTML. |
| `UI_DARK_MODE` | off | Dark/light theme toggle in the header and the dark palette. |
| `MCP_GENERATOR` | off | "Generate MCP" panel and `POST /api/mcp-generate`. The CLI works without it. |
| `MCP_GENERATOR_RATE_MAX`, `MCP_GENERATOR_RATE_WINDOW_SEC`, `MCP_GENERATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT` | `20`, `600`, `2` | Abuse limits of `POST /api/mcp-generate` (D-465): requests per client address per window, and simultaneous generations. `0` disables a limit. Over a limit the route answers 429 `{ message }` with `Retry-After`. In-memory, per process. Behind a reverse proxy every client may share one address; size the limits for that. |
| `MCP_TESTER` | off | `/mcp-test` page and `/api/mcp-test/runs` routes. The CLI works without it. |
| `MCP_TESTER_RUNTIME` | unset (in-process fakes) | Literal `container` runs the MCP tester in the runner image through the container runtime. Operator-set only. |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDINGS` | on | Only the literal `off` disables embeddings (ingest, warm-up, search). |
| `SEARCH_REAL_EMBEDDINGS` | unset | Test-only: `1` un-skips `src/lib/server/search/accuracy.real.test.ts` (downloads the model). Never set in deployments. |

### Core, auth and mail

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT`, `HOST` | `3000`, `0.0.0.0` (image) | adapter-node |
| `ORIGIN` | none; compose default `http://localhost:3000` | Public base URL for SvelteKit's CSRF origin check. Must match the public URL. |
| `CATALOG_DB_PATH` | `./db/catalog.db` (image `/app/db/catalog.db`) | |
| `HF_CACHE_DIR` | `./db/models` (image `/app/db/models`) | Embedding model cache |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | enabled | Only `false` disables sign-in |
| `AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAILS`, `AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | empty | Comma-separated allow-lists |
| `AUTH_DB_PATH` | `runtime/auth/auth.db` (image `/app/runtime/auth/auth.db`) | Sessions, login codes, rate limits |
| `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` | secure when the request URL is https | `true` forces, `false` disables |
| `BREVO_API_KEY`, `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM`, `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM_NAME` | none | Default mail transport |
| `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT` | none, `25` | Plain-TCP relay; overrides Brevo when set |

### Try It Out (container runner and direct model call)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | none | Used by the direct model call and the LLM proxy. Never given to containers. |
| `PI_LLM_UPSTREAM_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Upstream of the proxy `/api/llm/v1` |
| `PI_LLM_PROXY_URL` | `http://aic-agent-library:3000/api/llm/v1` | How Pi containers reach the app (compose pins its own) |
| `PI_RUNNER_ENABLED` | enabled | Only `false` disables the container runner |
| `PI_FALLBACK_ENABLED` | enabled | Only `false` stops falling back to the direct call when the engine is unreachable |
| `PI_RUNNER_IMAGE` | `localhost/pi-runner:latest` | Built from `Containerfile.pi-runner` |
| `PI_RUNNER_SOCKET` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock`, else `/run/podman/podman.sock` | |
| `PI_RUNNER_NETWORK` | `aic-pi-internal` | Must be an internal network |
| `PI_RUNNER_ALLOW_OPEN_EGRESS` | `false` | Only the literal `true` allows a non-internal network. Dev only. |
| `PI_RUNNER_FS_MODE` | `tmpfs` | `tmpfs` or `layer` |
| `PI_RUNNER_TOOLS` | `read,write,edit,grep,find,ls` | Subset of `read,write,edit,bash,grep,find,ls` |
| `PI_RUNNER_MAX_CONTAINERS` | 5 | 1 to 50 |
| `PI_RUNNER_ANON_SESSIONS_PER_CLIENT` | 5 per 10 min | 0 = unlimited (relevant when `AUTH_ENABLED=false`) |
| `PI_RUNNER_IDLE_TTL_MS`, `_MIN_IDLE_MS`, `_WARM_WAIT_MS`, `_JOB_TIMEOUT_MS` | 300000, 60000, 90000, 300000 | |
| `PI_RUNNER_MEMORY_MB`, `_CPUS`, `_PIDS` | 1024, 0.5, 200 | |
| `PI_RUNNER_WORK_TMPFS_MB`, `_TMP_TMPFS_MB`, `_AGENT_TMPFS_MB` | 256, 64, 16 | |
| `PI_JOB_TOKEN_BUDGET`, `PI_JOB_REQUEST_BUDGET` | 100000, 40 | Per job, enforced by the proxy |
| `TRYITOUT_USAGE_ENDPOINT` | unset (off) | Diagnostic, off by default; `1` enables `/api/tryitout/jobs/:id/usage`, which returns token counts only |
| `PI_RUNNER_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES`, `_MAX_OUTPUT_FILES` | 20971520, 200 | Output zip limits |
| `APP_INSTANCE_NAME` | `aic-agent-library` in `podman-compose.yml` (container hostname if unset elsewhere) | Owner label (`aic.owner`) on every runner container. The start-up orphan sweep removes only same-owner leftovers. Set a stable value such as `aic-prod`; the compose file does not set it yet. |
| `TRYITOUT_WORK_DIR` | `./.tryitout-work` (image `/app/runtime/tryitout-work`) | Job working files |
| `TRYITOUT_PROMPTS_DIR` | `./data/tryitout-prompts` | Agent skill/prompt files (shipped in the image) |
| `TRYOUT_STORAGE_PATH`, `TRYOUT_TEMPLATE_PATH` | `./runtime/try-out-sessions`, `./data/try-out/prompt-template.txt` | Legacy `/api/try-out` route |
| `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | set by the host session | Required and non-empty for Compose; locates the deployment user's rootless Podman socket on the host |

### Errors and support references

API error bodies are JSON with a `message` field (D-461). An unexpected server error shows the visitor a fixed message and `Reference: <8 hex chars>` (D-462); the same reference is in the server log line `[ref <id>] METHOD /path failed (status):` followed by the redacted error and stack. Ask the visitor for the reference and grep the log for it. Logs never contain secrets matching the shared token patterns.

### MCP test runner (only with `MCP_TESTER=1` and `MCP_TESTER_RUNTIME=container`)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MCPTEST_RUNNER_IMAGE` | `localhost/mcp-test-runner:latest` | From `Containerfile.mcp-test-runner` (not yet built or run: pending human) |
| `MCPTEST_NETWORK` | `aic-mcptest-internal` | Internal network, no egress |
| `MCPTEST_JOB_TIMEOUT_MS` | 300000 (runner default) | Passed as `PI_RUNNER_JOB_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| `MCPTEST_MEMORY_MB` | 1024 (runner default) | Passed as `PI_RUNNER_MEMORY_MB` |
| `MCPTEST_ALLOW_OPEN_EGRESS` | n/a | Setting it to `true` or `1` makes the config throw: the runner never gets egress |
| `MCPTEST_IN`, `MCPTEST_OUT`, `MCPTEST_PKG_ROOT` | set by the platform | In-container driver only; do not set by hand |

### Scripts only

`SCALE_COUNT` (150), `SCALE_SEED` (20260101), `SCALE_OUT_DIR` (`./data/fixtures-scale`) for `npm run fixtures:scale`.

## 4. Containers

Files: `Containerfile` (app, multi-stage), `Containerfile.pi-runner` (generic Pi image, `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.0.4`), `Containerfile.mcp-test-runner` (definition only; runs as user `pi`, uid 1000, like the Pi runner, D-464), `podman-compose.yml`, `.containerignore`.

```bash
# First installation only: copy .env.example to .env and replace placeholders.
# On upgrades, preserve the existing .env.
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/$(id -u)}"
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket || exit 1
test -S "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock" || {
    echo "Missing Podman socket: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock" >&2
    exit 1
}
podman build -t localhost/pi-runner:latest -f Containerfile.pi-runner .
podman-compose up -d --build    # builds the app image and starts it
```

Run the commands above as the same dedicated, non-root user that owns the
application containers, without `sudo`. The export applies to the current shell;
any deployment script or service must also supply that user's `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.

For an unattended server, an administrator can enable the deployment user's
systemd user manager at boot and after logout with
`sudo loginctl enable-linger <deployment-user>`. This keeps the enabled user
socket available; it does not itself configure the app containers to start at boot.

### Socket startup errors

- `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR must be set ...`: Compose stopped before creating the app.
  Export the runtime directory as shown above in the shell that invokes Compose.
- `statfs /podman/podman.sock: no such file or directory` with an older compose
  file: the variable expanded to an empty string. Update the file and set the variable.
- `statfs /run/user/.../podman/podman.sock: no such file or directory`: the path
  is set, but the socket is missing. Check `systemctl --user status podman.socket`
  and confirm the path belongs to the current deployment user. Do not create a
  directory or regular file in place of the socket.
- `Failed to connect to bus` from `systemctl --user`: log in directly over SSH as
  the deployment user and retry; a session entered through `su` or `sudo` may lack
  the user manager environment.
- `no container with name or ID "aic-agent-library" found` after a mount error:
  container creation failed; fix the first error and run Compose again.

`PI_RUNNER_SOCKET` is the app's path inside the container, pinned by Compose to
`/run/podman/podman.sock`. Changing it in `.env` does not change the host mount.
`PI_RUNNER_ENABLED=false` and `PI_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true` do not bypass the mount
requirement, since mounts are prepared before the app can start.

Notes from the files:

- The app image bakes `db/catalog.db` at build time (`drizzle-kit push --force`, `npm run ingest`, `npm run tryout:configure`, `vite build`, then a `SELECT` sanity check). To pick up new or changed agent YAML, rebuild the image. With no network at build time the image runs BM25-only. The model cache is copied with `db/` (`HF_CACHE_DIR=/app/db/models`).
- The runtime image runs as user `node`, ships production dependencies only (`npm prune --omit=dev`), and has a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/health`.
- Compose volumes: `auth-data` (`/app/runtime/auth`, login state), `tryout-sessions` (`/app/runtime/tryitout-work`). The host Podman socket is mounted at `/run/podman/podman.sock`; `userns_mode: keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000` and `security_opt: label=disable` make it usable. Mounting the socket gives the app control over that host user's containers: use a dedicated user.
- Compose pins `PI_RUNNER_NETWORK=aic-pi-internal` (an `internal: true` network where the app has the alias `aic-agent-library`), `PI_LLM_PROXY_URL=http://aic-agent-library:3000/api/llm/v1` and `PI_RUNNER_ALLOW_OPEN_EGRESS=false`; `PI_RUNNER_IMAGE`, `PI_RUNNER_FS_MODE` (`tmpfs`) and `PI_FALLBACK_ENABLED` (`true`) are overridable from `.env`.
- Run a single app replica per engine user: the orphan sweep at start-up assumes it. Set `APP_INSTANCE_NAME` (for example `aic-prod`) in `.env` or the compose environment so containers carry a stable owner label; otherwise the hostname changes whenever the container is recreated and leftovers are not swept.
- Resource limits need cgroup v2 delegation for rootless Podman.

## 5. Try It Out runtime requirements

- Image `localhost/pi-runner:latest` built on the host; Podman socket enabled for the app's user.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in `.env` (stays in the app; containers get a per-lease token and call the proxy).
- `npx tsx scripts/smoke-pi-runner.ts` (add `--proxy-host aic-agent-library` once the app is up) shows which `PI_RUNNER_FS_MODE` the host supports. It starts containers: run it only on the intended host.
- Only agents with `try_it_out_mode = 'runnable'` show the panel; `tryout:configure` sets that for `demo-rfi-triage`. If the engine is unreachable the job falls back to the direct model call (`PI_FALLBACK_ENABLED`).
- Job metadata is in memory; job links do not survive a restart.
- With `AGENT_KINDS` on, the job routes (403) and the prompt loaders refuse non-agent kinds.

## 6. Backups

- `db/` holds `catalog.db` (rebuildable from `data/agents/` with `npm run ingest`, so a backup is a convenience) and `db/models` (rebuildable, about 90 MB download).
- The data that cannot be rebuilt is the auth database (`runtime/auth/auth.db`, in the `auth-data` volume): sessions, rate limits and the `login_code_recipients` table. Back it up with SQLite's online backup (`sqlite3 auth.db ".backup out.db"`), or with the app stopped; the database may use WAL, so never copy only the main file of a running instance.
- Back up `.env` separately and securely (it contains keys); it is gitignored and never copied into the image.

## 7. Health check

- `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` (200) and is public even when sign-in is required. It answers 503 `{"message":"Service unavailable"}` when the database cannot be read or the `agents` table is missing (D-460); no cause is exposed, so check the container log. The image `HEALTHCHECK` calls it every 30 s.
- It proves the process serves HTTP and the catalog database is readable. Also check `/catalog` (needs sign-in unless `AUTH_ENABLED=false`) and, after start, the container log for `Try It Out service failed to start` or `Search warm-up failed` warnings (both non-fatal).
- Pre-release runtime check: `npm run smoke` builds the server and probes it across all flag configurations (see `docs/smoke-test.md`).

## 8. Rollback

1. Features: unset `AGENT_KINDS`, `MCP_GENERATOR`, `MCP_TESTER`, `MCP_TESTER_RUNTIME` (or set `0`) and restart. Flag-off behaviour is pinned byte-identical by `scripts/flag-off.golden.test.ts`. The `agent_kinds` table is a sidecar and can stay.
2. Try It Out: `PI_RUNNER_ENABLED=false` (direct call only).
3. Search: `SEARCH_EMBEDDINGS=off` and restart for keyword-only search.
4. Code: `git revert <commit>` on the deploy branch, rebuild the image, `podman-compose up -d --build`. Schema changes are additive (`agent_embeddings`, `agent_kinds`, `try_it_out_*` columns); if in doubt delete `db/catalog.db` and re-ingest (it is rebuildable).
5. Dependencies: see `docs/dependency-health.md` and D-253 in `.planning/AUTONOMOUS-DECISIONS.md` (revert the dependency commit, then `npm ci`).
6. Leftover containers: with the same `APP_INSTANCE_NAME` the next start sweeps them; otherwise list with `podman ps --filter label=aic.owner` and remove by hand (only on the intended host).

## 9. Pending-human live checks

Nothing below has been done. Each file is an unchecked checklist.

| Phase | What needs a human | File |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Browser check of catalog and detail pages (plan 02-04, not executed; Phase 2 is not complete) | `.planning/phases/02-catalog-and-detail/02-04-PLAN.md` |
| 3 Search | Real-model accuracy run, SIM_FLOOR tuning, real-embedding ingest, live-typing feel | `.planning/phases/03-search/03-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 4 Customize placeholder | Browser check of the Customize menu | `.planning/phases/04-customization-placeholder/04-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 9 Try It Out hardening | Nine live Podman checks (smoke, hardening inspect, network guard, owner-scoped sweep, hostile archive, hung engine, budget, reaper, cleanup) | `.planning/phases/09-try-it-out-hardening/09-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 10 Accessibility | Keyboard walk, screen readers, focus ring, zoom, real-browser contrast, reduced motion | `.planning/phases/10-accessibility-ui-03/10-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 11 Related agents | Browser check and real-catalog suggestion quality | `.planning/phases/11-related-agents-disc-01/11-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 13 Multi-format hosting | Browser checks with `AGENT_KINDS=1` | `.planning/phases/13-multi-agent-and-multi-format-hosting-flagged/13-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 14 MCP generator | fastmcp pin check on PyPI, run a generated server, CLI per fixture, panel and zip download | `.planning/phases/14-mcp-generator-generalized-from-research-flagged/14-HUMAN-UAT.md` |
| 15 MCP test platform | Runner image build, container run, real FastMCP comparison, auth hook check, browser checks | `.planning/phases/15-mcp-test-platform-flagged/15-HUMAN-UAT.md` |

Phases 1, 2.1, 2.2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 are verified `passed`. The first production container build is a human step.
