# Phase 07 Plan 02: Demo Agent, Skill File, and Mode-Flip Script Summary

**Created the `demo-rfi-triage` Oracle AgentSpec agent + its shipped `skill.md`/sample fixture, and a one-off idempotent DB script that flips it to `runnable` while reverting `hvac-load-calculator` to `none`**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-08-19T21:14:00Z (approx.)
- **Completed:** 2026-08-19T21:17:34Z
- **Tasks:** 2/2
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- `data/agents/demo-rfi-triage.yaml` ingests cleanly (`npm run ingest` — no `[SKIP]` line) into a `slug = 'demo-rfi-triage'` row with a real `system_prompt`, an explicit "DEMO ONLY" disclaimer, no `tools` key, and no `try_it_out` key
- `data/tryitout-prompts/demo-rfi-triage/skill.md` and `sample-rfi.txt` exist at the exact paths plan 07-03's prompt loader will read, encoding the D-02 urgency/discipline/routing/rationale triage task with a predictable labelled-line output contract
- `scripts/set-try-it-out-mode.ts` (`setTryItOutMode`) flips `demo-rfi-triage` to `runnable` and `hvac-load-calculator` back to `none` via a bound-parameter prepared UPDATE, verified idempotent and covered by a Phase-5-no-clobber regression test
- `.gitignore` now excludes `.tryitout-work/` ahead of plan 07-03 becoming its first writer

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create the demo-only agent YAML, its skill.md, and a sample RFI fixture** - `9675cf5` (feat)
2. **Task 2: One-off try_it_out_mode UPDATE script plus the .tryitout-work gitignore entry** - `2cdccd5` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** SUMMARY.md committed alongside this plan's task commits (worktree mode — orchestrator handles STATE.md/ROADMAP.md centrally after merge).

## Files Created/Modified
- `data/agents/demo-rfi-triage.yaml` - Oracle AgentSpec YAML for the one demo-only agent; DEMO ONLY disclaimer, no tools, no try_it_out key
- `data/tryitout-prompts/demo-rfi-triage/skill.md` - Shipped skill file: classify by urgency (critical/high/normal/low) and discipline (structural/MEP/architectural), then output Urgency/Discipline/Routing/Rationale labelled lines
- `data/tryitout-prompts/demo-rfi-triage/sample-rfi.txt` - 1226-byte realistic demo RFI (ductwork/beam clash) for the live demo
- `scripts/set-try-it-out-mode.ts` - `setTryItOutMode(dbPath)`: absolute-value idempotent UPDATE for the two targeted slugs, throws on zero-row match
- `scripts/set-try-it-out-mode.test.ts` - 4 passing tests: both mode flips, zero-match error, idempotence, re-ingest no-clobber regression
- `.gitignore` - Appended `.tryitout-work/` (1 line added, 0 removed, existing entries untouched)

## Decisions Made
- `llm_config` in the new YAML is present only for `OracleAgentSpecSchema` shape consistency (schema requires the block); a YAML comment states the Try It Out backend ignores it and always uses the fixed model/temperature from `src/lib/server/tryItOutModel.ts` (D-07, plan 07-01)
- `setTryItOutMode()` throws naming the unmatched slug on zero `changes`, rather than silently no-op-ing, so a forgotten `npm run ingest` step fails loudly instead of leaving stale mode values

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Both tasks' automated verify commands and all acceptance criteria passed on the first attempt; no Rule 1-3 auto-fixes were needed.

## Issues Encountered

- First `npm run ingest` run failed with `no such table: agents` because this worktree's `db/` directory (gitignored, per-worktree) had never been initialized. Ran `npm run db:push` (drizzle-kit push) once to create the table, matching the documented `npm run dev`/`npm run build` script chain (`db:push && ingest && ...`) — not a plan deviation, just the expected first-run bootstrap for a fresh worktree DB.
- `npm test` (full suite) showed 6 pre-existing failing test files (`src/lib/tryItOut.test.ts`, `TryItOutPanel.test.ts`, `try-it-out.test.ts`, `FilterBar.test.ts`, `TechAccordion.test.ts`, `CustomizationPanel.test.ts`) due to `node_modules/@testing-library/` being entirely absent in this worktree, despite being a listed devDependency. This is unrelated to any file this plan touches and is out of scope per the executor scope-boundary rule — logged to `deferred-items.md` in this phase directory rather than fixed. This plan's own new test suite (`scripts/set-try-it-out-mode.test.ts`, 4/4) and the other 48 previously-passing tests were unaffected.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required (this plan touches no `OPENAI_API_KEY`-dependent code; that lives in the parallel plan 07-01).

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 07-03's prompt loader can now read `data/tryitout-prompts/demo-rfi-triage/skill.md` and the `agents.system_prompt` DB column for `slug = 'demo-rfi-triage'` — both exist and are verified.
- The dev DB already reflects the target mode state (`demo-rfi-triage -> runnable`, `hvac-load-calculator -> none`) so plan 07-05's human checkpoint should find the right agent gated for the Try It Out panel once 07-03/07-04 land.
- Blocker/concern: the worktree's stale `node_modules/@testing-library/` gap (see Issues Encountered) should be reconciled (e.g. `npm install`) before any plan relying on the Svelte-component test suite is verified end to end — flagged in `deferred-items.md`, not fixed here as it is outside this plan's file scope.
