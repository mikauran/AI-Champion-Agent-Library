# Phase 26 Human UAT

Items an engineer should confirm. All agent outputs are drafts for engineer review; inputs are synthetic or public only.

## Pending on Ville

- Agent 5 (Product sourcing): attempted-not-counted (jobs e4181f2f, 24e650a3, 02bb5e13, see 26-VERIFICATION.md). Skim the last draft; confirm exact-equality matching is an acceptable default, and decide whether to accept a deterministic matching tool for this agent (BL-09 was lost by the model despite correct per-id tests).
- Decide whether stk-mcp / lvi-info-mcp should be reachable from Try It Out (links the live catalog access gap).
- Agent 6 (Quote comparison): counted (job eaee09d8, see 26-VERIFICATION.md). Skim the comparison draft; confirm that "no arithmetic, flag only" is the wanted division of labour and decide whether a deterministic normalising script (units, currency, VAT, totals) should follow.
- Agent 7 (Carbon and EPD enrichment): counted (job c61b9914, see 26-VERIFICATION.md; all EPD values synthetic). Skim the mapping draft; confirm map-and-flag with the calculation left to a script is the wanted split; decide which real EPD source (EPD Finland / Rakennustieto, EPD Norway, ECO Platform) to wire first and check its reuse terms.
